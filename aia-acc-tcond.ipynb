    "# Condensation Temperature Gradients as a Consequence of Different Nucleosynthetic Origins\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument is that two stars with different nucleosynthetic origins will exhibit a condensation temperature gradient relative to one another if they have different nucleosynthetic origins. This argument is rooted in the correlation between an element's condensation temperature and the fraction of its abundance that arises from core collapse supernovae (CSSNe). This notebook connects the differences in two values of $A_\\text{Ia}$ and $A_\\text{CC}$ (describing the amplitudes of the two enrichment processes; see e.g. Griffith et al. 2024) to the expected gradient in condensation temperature $T_\\text{cond}$ with $\\Delta$[X/Fe]."
